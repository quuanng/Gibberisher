# Gibberisher
Compile all files, and then run GibberisherMain to generate words. It is currently set to 5 letter sequences, generates 2000 words, and outputs 20, but can be adjusted to see other results by editing GibberisherMain.java.
If running into compilation error, try compiling Gibberisher and GibberisherMain after the others.
